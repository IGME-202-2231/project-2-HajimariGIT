nearClipPlane; what does this do unity c#


In Unity with C#, the nearClipPlane is a property of the camera component that specifies the distance from the camera to the near clipping plane.
 The near clipping plane is the closest plane to the camera that objects can be rendered on. 
Any objects that are closer to the camera than the near clipping plane won't be rendered and will be clipped from the view.

what does continue; do


In programming languages like C#, the continue statement is used within loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. 
It is often used in conjunction with conditional statements to control the flow of the loop.
